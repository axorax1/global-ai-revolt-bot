# Global AI Revolt Bot
Publicly trained AI bot for revolt.

Anyone can add data to the global AI database by using `g!add my cool message`

The bot can be trained on that data by using `g!train` (only the bot owner can use this command)

Then anyone can run the AI using `g!run hello`

**Prefix:** `g!` (Can be changed in "config.json")

**Note:**

```
There is no official global AI bot that is owned or maintained by the developer. You can self-host the bot if you want to use it.
```

### Steps to self-host:
1 - Fork the repository

2 - Clone the repository into your computer

3 - In the terminal, type `npm i`

4 - Put your bot token in the config.json file

5 - Type `node index` in the terminal and done!
